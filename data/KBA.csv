The system's functionality was significantly impacted, leading to this incident.",HDW,"Dev, PRD, DR  /home directory reach more than 95% of utilization",ICT,Hardware,Server pSeries,"Critical malfunction in Dev, PRD and DR server operations detected.","Analyze Disk Usage
SSH into the Server where the /home directory is located using your preferred terminal or tool.

ssh user@server-ip
Check disk space usage for the /home directory.

df -h /home
Find large files and directories in the /home directory to identify where the space is being consumed.

du -sh /home/* | sort -rh | head -10
Step 2: Investigate and Remove Unnecessary Files
Examine user home directories for old or unnecessary files, logs, or backups that can be deleted.

Check for large media files, logs, backups, or unused software installers that can be archived or removed.

find /home -type f -size +100M
Delete or move files that are no longer needed. Be cautious when deleting, as you may need permission from users.

rm /home/username/largefile.log
Compress files that are large but still needed.

gzip /home/username/largefile.log
Step 3: Offload Files to External Storage
Move large files to external storage or a different partition if the /home partition is small.

For example, move files to /mnt/storage if available:
mv /home/username/largefile.log /mnt/storage/
Use cloud storage or network drives (like NFS) if you can’t expand local storage.

Step 4: Clean Up Old Logs and Temporary Files
Clean log files in user directories, if applicable. Logs from applications like web servers or databases might be consuming a lot of space.

Empty or truncate log files:
> /home/username/application.log
Use automated cleanup tools such as tmpwatch or logrotate to keep log sizes in check.

Configure logrotate for log files in /home that grow quickly:
sudo logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf
Step 5: Analyze User Quotas
Check if users have exceeded their allocated disk quotas (if quotas are enabled).

repquota -a
Set or enforce user quotas to prevent individual users from consuming too much space in /home.

edquota username
Step 6: Monitor and Automate Disk Space Alerts
Set up a monitoring tool like Nagios, Zabbix, or CloudWatch (for AWS servers) to monitor disk space utilization and receive alerts when usage exceeds a threshold (e.g., 80%).

Schedule a periodic cleanup (like a cron job) to clear temporary or unimportant files automatically.

Example of a cron job to delete old files older than 30 days:
find /home/username/tmp -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm {} \;
Step 7: Expand the File System (Optional)
If disk space is a persistent issue, consider expanding the /home partition by:

Adding more storage space to the server.
Resizing or expanding the partition using tools like lvextend (for LVM partitions) or increasing the disk in the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, etc.).
Example for extending LVM:

lvextend -L +10G /dev/mapper/volumegroup-homelv
resize2fs /dev/mapper/volumegroup-homelv
Step 8: Final Check
After taking action, verify that the /home directory utilization has been reduced.

df -h /home
Ensure that services are functioning normally and that no critical files were removed unintentionally."
400000330, IGFMAS Access Application. The SAP system cannot be access.,NW,SAP system cannot be access,ICT ,Network,Network,IGFMAS Access Application can't be access,"Step 1: Check Network Connectivity
Ensure the network connection is active:

Check if your computer is connected to the correct network (Wi-Fi or LAN).
Test connectivity by trying to access other websites or services.
ping google.com
Verify network latency and packet loss:

Run a continuous ping to the SAP server (if you know the IP address).
ping <SAP_server_IP_address>
Look for high latency or packet loss. This might indicate network congestion or a faulty connection.
Step 2: Check SAP Server Connectivity
Ping the SAP server directly from your machine:

ping <SAP_server_IP>
If the ping is successful but you still cannot access SAP GUI, it may be an application-level issue.
Check if the SAP Application Server is accessible:

Use the telnet or nc command to test if you can reach the SAP server on the correct port (usually 3200 or 3600 for SAP GUI).
telnet <SAP_server_IP> 3200
or
nc -zv <SAP_server_IP> 3200
If this fails, the issue might be related to firewall rules or port blocking.

Step 3: Check Firewall Settings
Ensure the firewall on your local machine is not blocking SAP GUI access:

Disable the firewall temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.
For Windows:
Open Control Panel ? Windows Defender Firewall ? Turn off Windows Defender Firewall for private and public networks.
For Linux (if applicable):
sudo ufw disable
Check firewall settings on the network:

Verify with your network administrator that the ports required by SAP (3200, 3600) are open between your machine and the SAP server.

Step 4: Verify SAP GUI Configuration
Check the SAP logon configuration:

Open SAP GUI and verify that the correct application server, system number, and IP address are entered in the logon details.
Ensure there are no misconfigurations in the SAP GUI logon pad. If there’s an incorrect configuration or network address, correct it based on the network team’s inputs.

Step 5: DNS Issues
Check if DNS resolution is working:
If you're connecting to the SAP server using a hostname, ensure the DNS can resolve the hostname to the correct IP address.
nslookup <SAP_server_hostname>
If the hostname doesn’t resolve, update your hosts file or configure DNS properly.

Step 6: Check for SAP System Outage or Maintenance
Confirm that the SAP system is up:
Ask your system administrator or SAP Basis team if the SAP system is down for maintenance, or if there’s an outage.
Check for scheduled maintenance that might be affecting access.

Step 7: Network Troubleshooting Tools
Use traceroute or tracert to determine where the network connection is failing between your computer and the SAP server:

On Linux/Mac:
traceroute <SAP_server_IP>
On Windows:
tracert <SAP_server_IP>

This will show where the connection drops, indicating if it’s a local network issue or a broader network issue.
Check VPN connection (if applicable):

If your network requires a VPN to access the SAP system, ensure that your VPN connection is active and stable. Reconnect to the VPN if necessary.

Step 8: Check for Network Bandwidth Issues
Monitor network bandwidth to ensure there is enough bandwidth for SAP GUI to function.
Use tools like Task Manager (Windows) or iftop (Linux) to monitor network usage.

Step 9: Restart Router and Switches (if applicable)
Restart your local router or switch:
Sometimes the issue can be resolved by rebooting the router or network switch to refresh the connection.

Step 10: Contact IT Support
If the issue persists, escalate the problem to your network administrators or SAP Basis team to further investigate potential routing, network hardware, or server-side issues."
400000350,Cli* files in /tmp full. The system's functionality was significantly impacted.,BASIS,Cli* files,ICT,BASIS,SAP ECC,Cli* files in /tmp full,"Step 1: Check Disk Space Usage
Login to the server where SAP ECC is running.

ssh user@server-ip
Check the usage of /tmp to confirm if it is full or nearing capacity.

df -h /tmp
List large files in the /tmp directory, especially Cli* files:
ls -lh /tmp/Cli*

Step 2: Identify and Understand the Files
Check the purpose of the Cli* files:

These files are typically temporary files created by SAP processes.
It's important to check if the files are still in use before removing them.

Check the age of the files:

Older files are likely not in use and can be safely removed.
find /tmp/Cli* -mtime +7

This command will list files older than 7 days, which are likely safe to delete.

Step 3: Stop Unnecessary SAP Processes
Check if any SAP jobs or processes that generated these files are still running:
Use the SAP management console to check running processes or SAP background jobs that might be generating temporary files.
Stop long-running or stuck SAP processes (if they are responsible for the file buildup):
Log into SAP and go to Transaction SM37 to check for long-running or failed background jobs.
If required, terminate stuck processes to prevent further file creation.

Step 4: Safely Delete Temporary Files
Before deleting files, ensure they are not in use:

Use the lsof command to check if any files are currently open or in use by a process.
lsof | grep /tmp/Cli

If no processes are using the files, they are safe to delete.
Delete the Cli* files that are old and no longer needed:
Start by removing files older than a certain number of days (e.g., 7 days):
find /tmp/Cli* -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;
Alternatively, manually delete files:
rm /tmp/Cli*

Step 5: Monitor and Automate Cleanup
Set up a cron job to automatically clean up old files in /tmp:
This will help prevent /tmp from filling up again in the future.
Example cron job to delete files older than 7 days:
crontab -e
Add the following line to the cron job file:
0 2 * * * find /tmp/Cli* -mtime +7 -exec rm {} \;
This will run daily at 2 AM and delete any Cli* files older than 7 days.

Step 6: Increase /tmp Space (If Necessary)
If /tmp frequently fills up, consider increasing the partition size or moving the temporary files to another directory:
Resize the partition (if /tmp is a separate partition):
For example, using Logical Volume Management (LVM):
lvextend -L +5G /dev/mapper/volume-group-tmp
resize2fs /dev/mapper/volume-group-tmp
Reconfigure SAP to use a different directory for temporary files:
You can modify the profile parameters to change the directory where SAP stores temporary files, such as /usr/sap/tmp.

Step 7: Check SAP Configuration for Cleanup Jobs
Configure SAP housekeeping jobs:
SAP systems have predefined housekeeping jobs that clean up temporary files and logs. Ensure these jobs are scheduled properly.
Go to Transaction SM36 to check if the housekeeping jobs like RSCOLL00 and RSBTOSM1 are scheduled.
Review SAP parameters related to temporary file handling:
Check if there are configuration parameters that control the creation and cleanup of temporary files.
Parameters such as DIR_TEMP can be adjusted to ensure files are stored in an appropriate directory.

Step 8: Recheck Disk Space
Verify that disk space has been freed:
df -h /tmp
Ensure that there is now enough free space in the /tmp directory after deleting files.
Check if SAP ECC processes are functioning normally after the cleanup.

Step 9: Restart Services (if necessary)
If the issue persists, restart SAP services or the server to refresh the system and clear out any lingering issues:
Restarting SAP services:
sapcontrol -nr <instance_number> -function Stop
sapcontrol -nr <instance_number> -function Start"
